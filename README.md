# Python_Text_Scraper
This file uses the html2text module (https://pypi.org/project/html2text/) to iterate through a list of URLs from a spreadsheet and extract all the text on every webpage.

To use this file:
1) First, create a spreadhseet with one column which lists all the URLs you need to scrape the text from. (No headers are necessary, but the URLs must be in a clean format i.e. beginning with http:// or https:// and ending with / or white space).
2) Copy them all to your clipboard. 
3) Run the program in your shell or IDE.
