# Python_Text_Scraper
This file uses the html2text module to iterate through a list of URLs from a spreadsheet and extract all the text on every webpage.
To use this file, first, create a spreadhseet with one column which lists all the URLs you need to scrape the text from. No headers are necessary. 
Copy them all to your clipboard.
The URLs must be in a clean format i.e. beginning with http:// or https:// and ending with / or white space
